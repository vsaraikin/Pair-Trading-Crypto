# Pair-Trading-Crypto

This repository contains my research in Pair Trading. 

I was trying to find opportunities via arbitrage two coins. Backtest shows that there are certain opportunities but in fact backtest != real trading. So, I will certainly make an experiment with the real-life trading to be sure.
